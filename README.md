The source code of the application I developed for Udacity React Webinar: **"react-redux State connect and provider"**

Description: This example classroom application has the same UI and functionality with
the one we developed for the ["React component state VS Redux store"](https://github.com/erdemkeren/udacity-reactnd-redux-store-vs-react-component-state) webinar.

However, this one utilizes react-redux features where applicable.
